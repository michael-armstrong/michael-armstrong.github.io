    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my site.  As you can see from my resume, my work history is quite diverse, from serving dairy farmers, to landscaping, to a variety of retail positions.  A common theme throughout is customer service.  Even in the dirtiest of jobs one can carry oneself as a professional and provide a level of service that customers appreciate.  My goal now is to apply that  sense of professionalism and service in a new direction.  I have chosen to learn web development, with the objective of utilizing those skills to keep organizations visible as both technology and the people using it change.  </p>
        
        <p>I am currenty learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript by studying resources found on the Web.  MOOCs such as edX and Codecademy have been very useful in providing some structure, which I have supplemented with extensive use of the Mozilla Development Network's excellent references.  I chose not to purchase the certificates offered by these various programs as they appear to be of dubious value; I believe that my ability can speak for itself. </p>
